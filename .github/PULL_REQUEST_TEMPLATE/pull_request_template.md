## PR checklist

Closes #XXX <!-- If this PR fixes an issue, please link it here! -->

- [ ] This comment contains a description of changes (with reason).
- [ ] Check to see if a [nf-core module, or subworkflow](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) is available and usable for your pipeline.
- [ ] Feature branch is named `feature/<module_name>` for modules, or `feature/<subworkflow_name>` for subworkflows. For modules, if there is a subcommand use: `feature/<module_name>/<module_subcommand>`.
- [ ] If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
- [ ] If you've added a new tool - have you followed the module conventions in the [contribution docs](https://mskcc-omics-workflows.gitbook.io/omics-wf/GMaCKqX0TmAhUOoZmuc6).
- [ ] Use [nf-core data](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets) if possible for nf-tests. If not, use or add test data to [mskcc-omics-workflows/test-datasets](https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/test-datasets), following the repository guidelines, for nf-tests. Finally, if neither option is feasible, only add a stub nf-test.
- [ ] Remove all TODO statements.
- [ ] Emit the `versions.yml` file.
- [ ] Follow the naming conventions.
- [ ] Follow the parameters requirements.
- [ ] Follow the input/output options guidelines.
- [ ] Add a resource `label`.
- [ ] Use Jfrog if possible to fulfil software requirements.
- Ensure that the test works with either Docker / Singularity. Conda CI tests can be quite flaky:
  - For modules:
    - [ ] `nf-core modules --git-remote https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/modules.git -b <module_branch> test <MODULE> --profile docker`
    - [ ] `nf-core modules --git-remote https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/modules.git -b <module_branch> test <MODULE> --profile singularity`
    - [ ] `nf-core modules --git-remote https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/modules.git -b <module_branch> test <MODULE> --profile conda`
  - For subworkflows:
    - [ ] `nf-core subworkflows --git-remote https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/modules.git -b <subworkflow_branch> test <SUBWORKFLOW> --profile docker`
    - [ ] `nf-core subworkflows --git-remote https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/modules.git -b <subworkflow_branch> test <SUBWORKFLOW> --profile singularity`
    - [ ] `nf-core subworkflows --git-remote https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/modules.git -b <subworkflow_branch> test <SUBWORKFLOW> --profile conda`
