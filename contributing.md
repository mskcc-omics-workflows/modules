# Contributing

### Contributing

To contribute new and updated existing [modules](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/modules) and [subworkflows](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/subworkflows) to the mskcc-omics-workflows repository, please perform all development in a fork of the repository and open a pull request to merge changes into the master branch of the upstream repository.

Please follow nf-core's guides for contributing [modules](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/modules) and [subworkflows](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/subworkflows), but with two major differences:

1. Set the upstream repository of your development fork to https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/modules
2. When you are satisfied with your changes, open a pull request to the upstream repository, not the nf-core/modules repository

Additional recommendations for mskcc-omics-workflows are detailed below.

###

### Module development

Refer to nf-core's guide on [creating new modules](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/modules).

#### Testing Using nf-core/tools

When testing a module using `nf-core modules test` in the mskcc-omics-workflows/modules repo, the `--git-remote` argument and `-b` arguments must be used:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
nf-core modules --git-remote https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/modules.git -b <module_branch> test <tool> 
```
{% endcode %}

This is due to a quirk in nf-core/tools in which the org\_path (msk in this case) is pulled from the remote github instead of using the local .nf-core.yml. Note that your module branch must be pushed to remote for this to work. \
\
If you experience trouble using nf-test through nf-core/tools, you can always use nf-test directly:&#x20;

```
nf-test test --profile=docker --tag <module_tag>
```

That being said, testing through nf-core/tools is preferable as it checks snapshot stability by running nf-test twice and comparing snapshots for equality.&#x20;

#### Testing Using Stubs

All modules in mskcc-omics-workflows/modules should have a [`stub`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#stub) block to facilitate easier testing. This is not required in nf-core/modules repository or for nf-core/tools compatibility, but this feature makes it easier to quickly prototype workflow logic without using the real commands.

#### Ignoring Conda Tests

While mskcc-omics-workflows/modules encourages contributors to provide conda support for their modules, it is often not desirable or difficult to include for certain modules.\
\
In this case, the `environment.yml` can be left un-changed. And, the module of interest should be added to the [exclude block](https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/modules/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml#L333-L343) in the `test.yml` gitaction. This tells the test git-action to skip the conda tests for the specified module.&#x20;

For example, a module named `example_module` would have the following section in the exclude block:

```
      - profile: "conda"
        tags: example_module
```

### Subworkflow development

Refer to nf-core's guide on [creating new subworkflows](https://nf-co.re/tools#create-a-new-subworkflow).

#### Configuration

Creating a custom configuration file for a subworkflow in a Nextflow pipeline is a good practice for including useful settings without changing the process definitions of the module. That way a module can be reused in multiple workflows, but its implementation changes in the context of a subworkflow. Here are the steps to create and use a custom configuration file for a subworkflow:

1. Create a `nextflow.config` file in the directory where your subworkflow file is located.
2.  In the `nextflow.config` file, you can specify configurations specific to your subworkflow. These configurations can include command-line arguments, input data paths, output paths, and any other settings relevant to your subworkflow. Below is an example of what a nextflow.config file might look like this:

    ```
    process {

        withName: '.*:SUBWORKFLOW1:MODULE1' {
            ext.args = '-a 10 -b 70'
        }

        withName: '.*:SUBWORKFLOW1:MODULE2' {
            ext.args = "--dedup"
        }

    }
    ```
3. Include this configuration file in the configuration for each testing workflow. In the `nextflow.config` file in the directory where your subworkflow test files are located, use Nextflow's `includeConfig` keyword to add the subworkflow configuration to the test workflow initialization.

### Test data

Testing workflows for modules and subworkflows should make use of test-data that is very small (aggressively sub-sampled) and reused from a centralized location whenever possible. Refer to nf-core's guide on using their [existing test data](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/test\_data\_guidelines). An alternative source of data specific to MSKCC is currently available [here](https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/test-datasets).

In-house test datasets should always be as small as possible. Master branch is not used to store any test data, instead, different types of branches will host corresponding data files. For example, [argos](https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/test-datasets/tree/argos) contains test datasets for MSK Argos Pipeline, while [hg37](https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/test-datasets/tree/hg37) branch is for hg37 related reference files.

* If there is a new test dataset fitting in existing branches, please make a PR to the corresponding branch.
* If test data files do not fit the existing branches, please create a new feature branch and once they are ready, contact our Reviewer team to do final review and create official branch.

### When to contribute to mskcc-omics-workflows

Although developers at MSKCC can contribute to either the publicly available nf-core/modules repository or the institutional mskcc-omics-workflows/modules repository, there are cases in which the latter are more favorable. Developers are encouraged to contribute to our institutional modules repository under the following circumstances:

1. **Code/Packages that are private to MSKCC:**\
   If the software is intended solely for internal use within our organization, it should be housed in mskcc-omics-workflows/modules
2. **Subworkflows:**\
   Any subworkflow with institution-specific configurations should be housed in mskcc-omics-workflows/modules.
3. **Modules Intended For Use in Subworkflows:**\
   Currently, subworkflows in mskcc-omics-workflows/modules can only include modules and subworkflows from the same repository. Therefore, even if the module already exists in nf-core/modules, it may be necessary to replicate it in our institutional repo to make it accessible to other subworkflows.

### How to contribute to mskcc-omics-workflows

To contribute to mskcc-omics-workflows, please follow the steps below:

* **Step 0.** Check in the msk-omics-workflows/modules folder if there is already a module or a subworkflow that you want to create. If yes, please contact code owners for requesting a change (if applicable)
* **Step 1.** Create feature branch with the name **feature/\<new\_module\_name or new\_subworflow\_name>**   based on [develop](https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/modules/tree/develop) branch
* **Step 2.** Follow Module / Subworkflow Development sections to create new module / subworkflow. They must be tested successfully locally
* **Step 3.** Update `meta.yml` file in the module / subworkflow folder for all metadata (description) about the module / subworkflow
* **Step 4.** If there is in-house test datasets involved with the new module / subworkflow, please create a feature branch with the same name **feature/\<new\_module\_name or new\_subworflow\_name>** under [test-datasets](https://github.com/mskcc-omics-workflows/test-datasets) and upload with descriptive folder and file names. Please note the base branch should be the corresponding branch rather than master (see [above](contributing.md#test-data))
* **Step 5.** If there is a need to upload the docker image associated with this new module / subworkflow, please use this [page](image-management/) to upload to JFrog
* **Step 6.** Once local test is done, create PR to develop branch. PR title should contain "**Module**" for new modules and "**Subworkflow**" for new subworkflows
* **Step 7.** Once PR is created, an auto-testing will start run. Please make sure all the testing has passed. Meanwhile, a validation process will also start to verify the `meta.yml` file. If it fails in verifying, please fix it before moving forward
* **Step 8.** After auto-testing is successfully done, assigned reviewers from reviewer team will review the code. We require at least 1 approval from the reviewer team.
* **Step 9.** Create PR to corresponding branch for in-house datasets (if applicable)
* **Step 10.** After approval, PR will be merged to develop branch.&#x20;

`RULES`: PR commit message standards: For new modules, please use "**Module:\<module\_name>**" (NO SPACE between "Module:" and the actual module name). For new subworkflows, please use "**Subworkflow:\<subworkflow\_name>**" (NO SPACE between "Subworkflow:" and the actual subworkflow name). This is used to convert the new `meta.yml` to markdown file and add into this [section](broken-reference)

* **Release.** The release cycle is 2 weeks. You will see your module / subworkflow in main branch in 2 weeks, along with documentation in this main page
